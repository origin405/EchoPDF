   EchoPDF represents a significant personal and professional journey in software development. What began as my final year project in early December 2023 evolved into a comprehensive full-stack application over the course of five months, with about 4 months of work (excluding burnt outs, family trips, and breaks).
   
   Key milestones in the project's development:
   
   - Early December 2023: I started learning full-stack development for the first time, with only 4 months of front-end experience I've acquired from my internship with FusionEx Malaysia working with am charts and knockoutJS. 
   - Early January 2024: I completed initial MVP for final year project, deployed on Heroku after submission
   - February 2024: I completed final exams and pratically graduated with a general CS degree
   - Late February 2024: I decided and started to expand my final year project into a comprehensive startup/product-like application
   - July 15th 2024: Officially launched EchoPDF
   
   This project marks a rapid transition from a beginner in full-stack development to creating and deploying a complex'ish, AI-integrated web application. The development process hopefully shows my ability to quickly learn and implement new technologies effectively:
   
   - Learned and implemented React in just 2.5 weeks to create the application's backbone and complete the template gallery feature
   - Acquired proficiency in various full-stack technologies and frameworks, all learned from scratch during the project's development
   - Demonstrated initiative through several custom implementations:
     - Developed a custom markdown parser for handling ChatGPT streaming API text chunks
     - Created a custom highlight tool for PDF interaction
     - Integrated React with PDF.js by directly wrapping the PDF.js repo code, using webpack for bundling
     - Studied and customized PDF.js codebase to implement additional features and optimizations
     - Deployed with Google Cloud Platform VMs in 2 days, with some past experience failing to deploy on ElasticBeanstalk and sucessfully deploying on Heroku.
    
   Note that in some areas of EchoPDF development, it is currently implemented in a basic form or not implemented:
   
   - Complex DevOps practices
   - Automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
   - Comprehensive unit testing
   - Type safety (e.g., TypeScript)
   - Caching solutions (e.g., Redis)
   - Advanced deployment practices (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
   
   The project currently uses a basic form of continuous deployment:
   - Code is pushed directly to the GitHub repository
   - Deployment is done manually via SSH, using commands to pull from the main branch, build, and restart the application
   
   While this approach works for the current scale, it's recognized that more robust, automated CI/CD pipelines would be beneficial as the project grows.
   
   These more advanced aspects, while crucial in larger-scale, production-level applications, were not fully implemented in the current version of EchoPDF due to its current scale and development timeline. However, their importance in professional software development is well understood.
   
   As EchoPDF scales and I grow, there's a clear roadmap for enhancing these practices:
   
   - Automating the CI/CD pipeline for more robust and consistent deployment processes
   - Introducing comprehensive unit tests to ensure code reliability
   - Considering the adoption of TypeScript for enhanced type safety
   - Exploring caching solutions to improve performance
   - Investigating containerization and orchestration for more scalable deployment
   
   Given the demonstrated ability to quickly learn and implement new technologies throughout this project, there's confidence in rapidly acquiring and applying these additional skills as the project scales. The journey of EchoPDF showcases not just my current abilities, but also my capacity and willingness to continually learn and adapt to best practices in software development.
   EchoPDF demonstrates not only technical skills, but also the capacity for rapid learning, problem-solving, and taking initiative in software development. It represents an ongoing journey of growth and improvement, with plans for future enhancements in PDF viewing, annotation capabilities, and overall user experience.

- AI: ChatGPT API (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- Deployment: Google Cloud Platform (Compute Engine)

### PDF Viewer Selection
When I started building EchoPDF, it began as my final year project - a much simpler version of what it is now. One of the toughest decisions early on was choosing a PDF viewer library. Being my first real development project, I wanted to stick with vanilla JavaScript, ruling out npm packages like react-pdf. This left me with either pdf.js dist or the pdf.js repo.
I was pretty set on including as many essential PDF features as possible - annotations, sidebar, word search, you name it. This bias stuck with me even as EchoPDF evolved. I ended up choosing the pdf.js repo code, despite it being more challenging to work with, because it offered the full range of features I wanted.

### Frontend Framework
For the framework, I went with React. It's popular, which usually means good community support, and I liked how the latest updates seemed to clean up a lot of the code complexity. Plus, it plays nice with Clerk and Stripe, offering component support which is a huge plus.
Integrating pdf.js with React was a bit of a head-scratcher. I had to decide between migrating pdf.js to my Create React App setup (where I'd already built the template gallery and auth routing) or bringing React into pdf.js. In the end, I moved React into pdf.js and used webpack to run JSX. I had to wrap the pdf.js web viewer with React to make it work as a component, mainly because I needed the viewer to take up half the screen width with an adjustable bar.

### CSS Framework
For styling, I chose Tailwind CSS. It was a bit of a learning curve at first, but I quickly found it incredibly efficient for rapid UI development. The utility-first approach allowed me to create consistent designs without leaving my HTML (or JSX in this case). It also integrates well with React, making component styling a breeze. The purge feature in production builds keeps the final CSS bundle small, which is great for performance. Overall, Tailwind CSS proved to be a great choice for building a responsive and visually appealing interface for EchoPDF.

### Backend
For the backend, I went with Express. It just seems like the go-to for JavaScript backends, and I didn't see any close seconds. MongoDB was my choice for the database. It's easy to use and efficient to query. For this kind of app, with lots of component-based data that doesn't really need to talk to each other much, NoSQL felt like a better fit than SQL.

### Payment Processing
Stripe was the obvious choice for payments. Their test environment, reasonable pricing (1 MYR + 3%), and CLI tools for webhook testing were crucial for building a solid, bug-free payment system.

### Authentication
I picked Clerk for authentication somewhat impulsively. It's popular, has a free tier, and offers components for both vanilla JS and React. In hindsight, since I deployed on Google Cloud, Firebase might have been a more cohesive choice, offering centralized auth and database services. But I stuck with Clerk and MongoDB since I was already familiar with them.

### Vector Database
For vector storage, I went with Pinecone DB. I learned about it through a YouTube tutorial that taught me the basics of vectorizing PDF content and using OpenAI's Ada 2 for embeddings. The pricing is very reasonable with their serverless tier.

### File Storage
I stuck with AWS S3 for file storage because I'd used it in my final year project and found it reliable and easy to set up. Again, Firebase storage could have been an option for more centralization, but I went with what I knew.

### AI Model
ChatGPT was really the only game in town for the AI model. The 3.5 model works great for the base offer, with GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4 offered as premium options. I'm considering adding Anthropic models in the future, especially since their Sonnet 3.5 is probably the best model out there right now.

### Deployment
For deployment, I went with Google Cloud Platform, using a Compute Engine VM with 10GB RAM and 2 cores running Debian Linux. It took two full days to deploy, but I think it was worth it for the customization options. I'm using Nginx to route traffic to my proxy server on port 3001, and I've set up SSL certs which are crucial for Stripe and for user trust.

### DevOps
My DevOps setup is pretty basic - I'm using GitHub for version control, pulling code to my VM, and using PM2 to manage my server instance. This setup allows for near-zero downtime during code pushes.
I haven't gotten into Docker or Kubernetes yet - for now, this setup is working well for the scale of EchoPDF.

## 5.0 Architecture Overview

### 5.1 Overall System Architecture

EchoPDF follows a modern web application architecture, combining a Single Page Application (SPA) frontend with a RESTful API backend. This setup is implemented as a "Single-Repository Decoupled Architecture" or a "Monorepo with Decoupled Frontend and Backend."

**Current Implementation:**
- Frontend: React-based SPA
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework
- Repository Structure: Monorepo (frontend and backend in one repository)
- Build Process: Webpack for bundling frontend code
- Deployment: PM2 runs the server, which serves static files from the public build directory

The frontend, built with React, handles the user interface and client-side logic. It communicates with the backend through RESTful API calls. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, processes these requests, interacts with the database and external services, and sends responses back to the frontend.

**Key Architectural Aspects:**
1. Component-Based Frontend: React's component architecture allows for modular, reusable UI elements.
2. Single Page Application: Provides a fluid, desktop-like user experience with minimal page reloads.
3. RESTful Backend: Express.js server structured to handle API requests efficiently.
4. Decoupled Design: Despite being in one repository, frontend and backend concerns are separated.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Multi-Page Application (MPA): Traditional website structure with separate HTML pages.
   - Pros: Better SEO out of the box, simpler architecture for very simple sites.
   - Cons: Slower navigation, more server load, less fluid user experience.

2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
   - Pros: Better initial load times, improved SEO.
   - Cons: More complex setup, potentially unnecessary for EchoPDF's core functionality.

3. Microservices Architecture:
   - Pros: Highly scalable, allows independent scaling of different features.
   - Cons: More complex to set up and manage, potentially overkill for the current scale of EchoPDF.

**Reasoning:**
The chosen architecture strikes a balance between development simplicity and application performance. The SPA approach is well-suited for EchoPDF's interactive nature, providing a smooth user experience for PDF viewing and AI interactions. The monorepo structure simplifies development and deployment processes while still maintaining a clear separation of frontend and backend concerns.

**Considerations for Improvement:**
1. SEO Optimization: If needed, implement SSR for specific routes (e.g., landing page, documentation) using a framework like Next.js.
2. State Management: As the application grows, consider introducing a more robust state management solution.
3. Code Splitting: Implement lazy loading for different parts of the application to improve initial load times.
4. API Gateway: For future scaling, consider introducing an API gateway for better request management and potential microservices integration.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for EchoPDF's current needs while leaving room for future scaling and feature additions. The modular nature of this setup allows for incremental improvements and optimizations as the user base and feature set grow.

## 5.2 Frontend Architecture

EchoPDF's frontend is built using React, embracing a component-based architecture that prioritizes modularity, reusability, and clear separation of concerns. This approach allows for efficient development and easier maintenance as the application grows.

### Key Components:
1. React: The core library used for building the user interface.
2. Context API: Used for state management, avoiding the need for more complex solutions like Redux.
3. Tailwind CSS: Utilized for styling, providing a utility-first approach to CSS.

### State Management:
1. Context API is the primary method for managing global state.
2. The application follows a rule of allowing one level of prop drilling. Any state that needs to be passed down more than one level is managed through Context.
3. This approach balances the simplicity of prop passing with the power of centralized state management.

### Component Structure:
The frontend is organized into several key directories:

1. **Pages**:
   - Contains top-level components that represent entire pages.
   - Each page component is responsible for layout and composing smaller components.

2. **Components**:
   - Houses reusable UI components.
   - Organized into sub-folders based on the specific pages or features they relate to.
   - This structure helps in quickly locating and managing related components.

3. **Layout**:
   - Contains components that define the overall structure of the application (e.g., headers, footers, navigation).

4. **Utils**:
   - Includes utility functions and helper code used across the application.

### Performance Optimizations:
1. **Code Splitting**: Utilizes React.lazy() and Suspense for lazy-loading components.
   - This approach improves initial load times by only loading necessary components.
   - Particularly beneficial for larger features or less frequently accessed parts of the application.

2. **Dynamic Imports**: Employed for route-based code splitting, ensuring that code for each route is loaded on demand.

### Styling Approach:
1. Tailwind CSS is used for styling components.
2. This utility-first approach allows for rapid UI development and consistent design across the application.

### Design Principles:
1. Modularity: Components are designed to be self-contained and reusable where possible.
2. Separation of Concerns: Each component has a clear, specific responsibility.
3. Hierarchical Structure: The component tree is organized to reflect the natural hierarchy of the UI.

### Data Flow:
1. API calls are typically made from page-level components or custom hooks using fetch.
2. Data is then passed down to child components via props or made available through Context.
3. Components use local state (useState hook) for managing component-specific data.

### Considerations and Future Improvements:
1. Performance Optimization: Regular audits using React DevTools to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
2. Accessibility: Ensure all components meet WCAG guidelines for accessibility.
3. Testing: Implement a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit tests, using frameworks like Cypress for frontend and Mocha for backend, for utility functions and components.

---

This frontend architecture provides a balance between simplicity and scalability. The use of Context API for state management keeps the application's data flow straightforward, while the modular component structure allows for easy expansion and maintenance. As EchoPDF grows, this architecture can be easily adapted to incorporate more advanced patterns or optimizations as needed.

   - Implements custom validation logic where necessary

2. **Atomic Operations**
   - Uses MongoDB's atomic operations for critical updates (e.g., credit management)

3. **Timestamps**
   - Automatic timestamp management for tracking document creation and updates

---

This database architecture provides a solid foundation for EchoPDF, offering flexibility, performance, and scalability. The NoSQL approach of MongoDB aligns well with the application's needs, allowing for rapid development and easy adaptation to changing requirements. The thoughtful schema design, with its focus on denormalization and efficient querying, ensures that the database can handle the application's current needs while being prepared for future growth and feature additions.

## 6. Core Components

### 6.1 User Authentication and Authorization

EchoPDF implements a robust user authentication and authorization system using Clerk, ensuring secure access to the application's features and protecting user data.

#### Clerk Integration

- The application is wrapped with `ClerkProvider` in the root `App.js` file, providing authentication context throughout the app.
- Clerk's `SignInPage` and `SignUpPage` components are used for user registration and login, offering a seamless and secure authentication experience.

#### Protected Routes and Components

- A custom `ProtectedRoute` component is implemented using React Router and Clerk's `useAuth` hook.
- This component ensures that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application:
  ```jsx
  const ProtectedRoute = () => {
    const { isSignedIn, isLoaded } = useAuth();
    if (!isLoaded) return <LoadingSpinner />;
    return isSignedIn ? <Outlet /> : <Navigate to="/sign-in" />;
  };
  ```
  Protected routes are wrapped with this component in the main routing structure.

User Session Management

User session data is managed through a custom UserContext and UserProvider.
This context fetches and stores user details, including subscription status and usage metrics, making this information readily available throughout the application.

Backend Authentication

The backend uses ClerkExpressRequireAuth() middleware to protect sensitive endpoints.
This middleware verifies the authentication token sent from the frontend and attaches the user ID to req.auth.
Example of a protected endpoint:
```javascript
 app.post('/api/user', ClerkExpressRequireAuth(), async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.auth.userId;
  // Process authenticated user request
});
```

Security Considerations

All sensitive operations, both on the frontend and backend, are protected behind authentication checks.
User data is securely stored and managed using Clerk's best practices, reducing the risk of data breaches.
The application adheres to modern security standards, including HTTPS enforcement and secure cookie handling.

This authentication and authorization system ensures that EchoPDF provides a secure environment for users to interact with their PDF documents and AI features, while also demonstrating best practices in web application security.

### 6.2 Template Gallery
The Template Gallery is a core feature of EchoPDF, providing users with a rich collection of community-created prompt templates. This feature enhances user experience by offering ready-to-use templates and fostering community engagement.

#### Template Post Structure and Functionality

Schema Design: The Template schema includes fields for title, description, tags, user information, template content, application type, interaction metrics (upvotes, downvotes, flags), creation timestamp, categories, and copy count.
Rich Content: Each template post contains detailed information including the author's profile, creation date, and a comprehensive template structure with customizable parameters.

```javascript
const templateSchema = new Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  tags: [{ type: String }],
  userId: { type: String, required: true },
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  profileImageUrl: { type: String, required: false, default: null },
  template: {
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    parameters: [
      {
        key: { type: String, required: true },
        value: { type: String, required: true },
      },
    ],
    description: { type: String, required: false },
  },
  applyTo: { type: String, required: true },
  upvotes: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  downvotes: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  flags: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  categories: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Category" }],
  parentCategories: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Category" }],
  copyCount: { type: Number, default: 0 },
});
```
#### Real-time Interaction Features

Voting System: Users can upvote or downvote templates, with real-time updates reflected in the UI.
Flagging Mechanism: A flagging system is implemented for community moderation.
Interaction Tracking: User interactions (votes, flags) are tracked using a separate Interaction schema, ensuring one interaction per user per post.

```javascript
const [interactionCounts, setInteractionCounts] = useState({
  upvotes,
  downvotes,
  flags,
});

const handleUpvote = async () => {
  const newCounts = { ...interactionCounts };
  if (userInteraction?.vote === "upvote") {
    newCounts.upvotes -= 1;
  } else {
    newCounts.upvotes += 1;
    if (userInteraction?.vote === "downvote") {
      newCounts.downvotes -= 1;
    }
  }
  setInteractionCounts(newCounts);
  await updateInteraction(postId, "upvote");
};
```
Categorization and Tagging System

Hierarchical Categories: Templates are associated with both immediate and parent categories for flexible querying.
Tag Categories: A separate schema manages tag categories, allowing for organized and searchable tag collections.

```javascript
const tagCategorySchema = new Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  tags: [{ type: String, required: true }],
});
```
#### Sorting and Filtering Implementation

Server-side Sorting: The API supports sorting templates based on various criteria (e.g., upvotes, creation date).
Pagination: Implemented to manage large numbers of templates efficiently.
Category-based Filtering: Templates can be filtered by category, including subcategories.

```javascript
app.get("/api/templates", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { categoryID, sort, page, limit = 12 } = req.query;
    const skip = (page - 1) * limit;
    let query = {};
    if (categoryID) {
      query = {
        $or: [{ categories: categoryID }, { parentCategories: categoryID }],
      };
    }

    const templates = await Template.find(query)
      .sort({ [sort]: -1 })
      .skip(skip)
      .limit(Number(limit));
    res.json(templates);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching templates:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```
#### UI Components and Interaction

Template Post Card: A custom React component (TemplatePostCard) displays template information in a visually appealing, responsive, and interactive card format.
Modal View: Clicking on a template opens a detailed modal view (PostTemplate) for a comprehensive look at the template.
Category Navigation: The CategoryPage component provides an intuitive interface for browsing templates within specific categories.

```jsx
const CategoryPage = () => {
  // ... (other code)

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center mb-2">
      <div className="p-8">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold mb-4">{categoryData.name}</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="pb-10"></div>
      <div className="flex flex-col">
        <div className="w-full px-8">
          <div className="container mx-auto">
            <div className={`grid ${gridClass}`}>
              {renderSubcategories(categoryData.children)}
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        {/* ... (other UI elements) */}
        <div className="w-full px-8 pb-12">
          <div className="container mx-auto">
            <div className="grid md:grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
              {templates.map((template, index) => (
                <TemplatePostCard
                  key={index}
                  {...template}
                  template={template.template}
                  postId={template._id}
                />
              ))}
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <Pagination currentPage={currentPage} setCurrentPage={setCurrentPage} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

This comprehensive template gallery system provides users with a powerful tool for discovering, sharing, and interacting with prompt templates, significantly enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of EchoPDF. The implementation showcases the use of React for dynamic UI rendering, state management for real-time interactions, and efficient backend querying for template retrieval and filtering.

### 6.3 Subscription Management
EchoPDF's subscription management system is a core component that seamlessly integrates with Stripe for payment processing and user tier management. This system is designed to handle various subscription scenarios, from free tier users to premium subscribers, while also incorporating a flexible credit purchase system for advanced features.
At the heart of the subscription management is the User model, which includes detailed fields for tracking subscription status, tier, credit balance, and payment history. This comprehensive data model allows for granular control over user permissions and feature access based on their subscription status.
The system employs a robust middleware check to ensure that user tiers are always up-to-date:
```javascript
const checkSubscription = async (req, res, next) => {
  const user = await User.findOne({ clerkUserId: req.auth.userId });
  if (user.tier !== "free" && !user.isSubscriptionActive()) {
    user.tier = "free";
    await user.save();
    console.log(
      `User ${user.clerkUserId} downgraded to free tier due to inactive subscription`
    );
  }
  next();
};
```

This middleware automatically downgrades users to the free tier if their subscription becomes inactive, ensuring that access to premium features is properly restricted.
The Subscription Manager component provides users with a comprehensive interface to manage their subscription. For subscribed users, it displays current subscription details, including the plan name, status, and next billing date. Users can cancel their current subscription directly from this interface. The system also handles subscription changes, allowing users to upgrade or downgrade their plan.

On the pricing page, the system dynamically adjusts the display and functionality of plan buttons based on the user's current subscription status. For instance, the button for the user's current plan is disabled to prevent unnecessary repurchases. Other plan buttons are labeled "Change to this Plan," enabling users to switch their subscription. This change isn't immediate; instead, it schedules the switch to occur at the end of the current billing cycle. Users also have the option to cancel this scheduled switch if they change their mind before it takes effect.
The backend of the subscription system is built around Stripe's webhook system, allowing real-time updates to user subscriptions. The webhook handler processes various events such as subscription creation, updates, cancellations, and successful payments. Here's an example of how the system handles a subscription update:

```javascript
async function handleSubscriptionUpdated(subscription) {
  const user = await User.findOne({ stripeCustomerId: subscription.customer });
  if (!user) return;

  const subscriptionItem = subscription.items.data[0];
  const newTier = mapPriceIdToTier(subscriptionItem.price.id);
  const planName = mapPriceIdToName(subscriptionItem.price.id);

  user.subscription = {
    status: subscription.status,
    stripeSubscriptionId: subscription.id,
    currentPeriodEnd: new Date(subscription.current_period_end * 1000),
    stripePriceId: subscriptionItem.price.id,
    planName: planName,
  };

  user.tier = newTier;
  await user.save();

  logSubscriptionUpdated(user.id, subscription, newTier, user.tier, planName);
  updateUserSubscriptionHistory(user, "SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATED", {
    newTier: newTier,
    oldTier: user.tier,
    planName: planName,
    endDate: user.subscription.currentPeriodEnd,
  });
}
```

This function updates the user's subscription details, adjusts their tier, and logs the change for tracking purposes.
The credit system is integrated into the subscription management, allowing users with active subscriptions to purchase additional credits for advanced features. The system offers tiered credit packages with bonus credits for larger purchases, incentivizing users to buy in bulk.

Overall, EchoPDF's subscription management system demonstrates a careful approach to handling user subscriptions, integrating seamlessly with Stripe for payment processing, and managing a flexible credit system. It showcases the ability to handle complex payment scenarios, maintain detailed user subscription states, and process real-time updates through webhooks, all while providing a user-friendly interface for subscription management.

### 6.4 Document Management
EchoPDF's document management system is a core component of the application, handling PDF uploads, storage, and organization. This system is designed with scalability, security, and user experience in mind, while implementing tiered access controls.

PDF Upload Process and Progress Tracking

The upload process utilizes Multer for handling multipart/form-data and implements real-time progress tracking:

```javascript
const upload = multer({
  storage: multer.memoryStorage(),
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    if (file.mimetype === "application/pdf") {
      cb(null, true);
    } else {
      cb(new multer.MulterError("LIMIT_UNEXPECTED_FILE"), false);
    }
  },
  limits: { fileSize: 100 * 1024 * 1024, files: 1 }, // 100 MB file size limit
});
```
Real-time progress tracking is implemented using Server-Sent Events (SSE):
```javascript
app.get("/progress", (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {
    "Content-Type": "text/event-stream",
    "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
    Connection: "keep-alive",
  });
  clients.push(res);
  req.on("close", () => {
    clients = clients.filter(client => client !== res);
  });
});

const sendProgress = (fileId, progress) => {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    client.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ fileId, progress })}\n\n`);
  });
};
```

#### Tiered Upload Limits

EchoPDF implements a simple tiered system with different upload limits for each subscription level:
```javascript
const tierLimits = {
  free: {
    totalPages: 200,
    perFilePages: Infinity,
    size: 10 * 1024 * 1024,
    maxFiles: 50,
  },
  echoplus: {
    totalPages: Infinity,
    perFilePages: 550,
    size: 50 * 1024 * 1024,
    maxFiles: 100,
  },
  echopro: {
    totalPages: Infinity,
    perFilePages: 800,
    size: 70 * 1024 * 1024,
    maxFiles: 200,
  },
};
```

#### Middleware Checks for Upload Limits and File Validation

A custom middleware uploadTierCheckMiddleware enforces these limits:
```javascript
const uploadTierCheckMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  const user = await User.findOne({ clerkUserId: req.auth.userId });
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).json({
      errorType: "USER_NOT_FOUND",
      message: "User authentication error. Please try logging out and back in.",
    });
  }

  const limit = tierLimits[user.tier];
  const tierName = tierDisplayNames[user.tier];

  // Check max files upload limit
  if (user.usage.filesUploaded >= limit.maxFiles) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      errorType: "TIER_MAX_FILES_EXCEEDED",
      message: `You've reached the maximum number of file space for your ${tierName} tier. Please delete existing PDF files to make space for new uploads.`,
      currentFiles: user.usage.filesUploaded,
      limit: limit.maxFiles,
      upgradeRequired: user.tier !== "echopro",
    });
  }

  // Additional checks for file size, page count, and total pages...

  req.user = user;
  req.pageCount = pageCount;
  next();
};
```

#### AWS S3 Integration for Secure File Storage

Files are securely stored in AWS S3, with progress tracking:

```javascript
const managedUpload = s3.upload(uploadParams);

managedUpload.on("httpUploadProgress", progress => {
  const progressPercentage = Math.round((progress.loaded / progress.total) * 100);
  sendProgress(uuid, progressPercentage);
});

const uploadResult = await managedUpload.promise();
```

#### Database Integration

After successful S3 upload, file metadata is stored in MongoDB:

```javascript
const pdfFile = new PdfFile({
  uuid: uuid,
  name: stripPdfExtension(file.originalname),
  folderId: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(folderId),
  userId: userId,
  s3Url: uploadResult.Location,
  key: `${userId}/${uuid}`,
  fileSize: file.size,
});

await pdfFile.save();
```

#### Folder Structure Implementation

A MongoDB schema defines the folder structure:
```javascript
const folderSchema = new Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  parentId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Folder", default: null },
  userId: { type: String, required: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  openedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
folderSchema.index({ userId: 1, parentId: 1 });
```

#### User Interface for Document Management

The DisplayFileList component provides a user-friendly interface for managing uploaded files:
```jsx
const DisplayFileList = ({ files, setFiles, selectedFiles, setSelectedFiles, folders, currentFolder }) => {
  // ... component logic

  return (
    <div className="overflow-x-auto flex-grow select-none">
      <table className="min-w-full h-full">
        <thead>
          {/* ... table headers */}
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {sortedFiles.map(file => (
            <tr key={file._id} className={`relative ${selectedFiles.includes(file._id) ? "bg-gray-200" : ""} group hover:bg-background-light`}>
              {/* ... file row content */}
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
      {/* ... modals for delete and move actions */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Security Measures

Files are stored in S3 with user-specific prefixes: ${userId}/${uuid}
Clerk authentication ensures users can only access their own files
Custom middleware validates user permissions for each file operation

#### Performance Optimizations
1. Asynchronous Operations
EchoPDF utilizes asynchronous programming extensively throughout the upload process, which is needed for maintaining application responsiveness:
```javascript
app.post("/api/upload-pdf-to-s3", upload.single("file"), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Asynchronous operations
    await req.user.updateFileUploadUsage(req.pageCount);
    const uploadResult = await managedUpload.promise();
    await pdfFile.save();
    // ...
  } catch (err) {
    // Error handling
  }
});
```
This approach prevents long-running operations from blocking the event loop, allowing the server to handle multiple requests concurrently.
2. Streaming Uploads
Instead of loading entire files into memory, EchoPDF implements streaming uploads to S3:
javascriptCopyconst managedUpload = s3.upload(uploadParams);
managedUpload.on("httpUploadProgress", progress => {
  const progressPercentage = Math.round((progress.loaded / progress.total) * 100);
  sendProgress(uuid, progressPercentage);
});
This method is more memory-efficient, especially for large files, as it doesn't require the entire file to be buffered in memory before uploading.
3. Efficient Database Queries
EchoPDF implements indexing on the folder schema to optimize database queries:
javascriptCopyfolderSchema.index({ userId: 1, parentId: 1 });
This compound index allows for faster queries when retrieving folders for a specific user and parent folder, which is a common operation in the folder structure.
4. Middleware Chain Optimization
The middleware chain is structured to fail fast. For example, the checkPdfProtection middleware runs before more intensive operations:
```javascript
app.post(
  "/api/upload-pdf-to-s3",
  upload.single("file"),
  checkPdfProtection,
  ClerkExpressRequireAuth(),
  checkSubscription,
  uploadTierCheckMiddleware,
  async (req, res) => {
    // ...
  }
);
```
This order ensures that invalid requests are rejected early in the process, saving server resources.


This document management system forms a critical part of EchoPDF, showcasing the integration of various technologies (MongoDB, AWS S3, Multer) while addressing important aspects such as security, performance, and user experience. The tiered upload system demonstrates a well rounded approach to user management and resource allocation, crucial for a SaaS product like EchoPDF.




## 7. Key Technical Challenges
## 7.1 Implementing Real-time Social Interactions with Optimistic Updates

### Problem

The initial implementation of the template gallery's social features (upvoting, downvoting, and flagging) resulted in a noticeable delay between user actions and UI updates. This lag was due to waiting for server confirmation before updating the interface, leading to a suboptimal user experience.

### Initial Approach

The first implementation followed a standard request-response pattern:
1. User interacts with a template (e.g., upvotes)
2. Send a request to the server
3. Wait for the server's response
4. Update the UI based on the server's response

This approach led to several issues:
* Users experienced a delay between their action and seeing the result
* The UI could become out of sync if multiple users interacted simultaneously
* Poor network conditions significantly degraded the user experience

### Solution: Optimistic Updates

To address these issues, I implemented an optimistic update strategy:

1. Created an InteractionContext to manage interaction state across components:

```javascript
export const InteractionProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [interactions, setInteractions] = useState([]);
  // ... other code ...
  return (
    <InteractionContext.Provider value={{ interactions, updateInteraction }}>
      {children}
    </InteractionContext.Provider>
  );
};
```
2. Implemented optimistic update logic in the updateInteraction function:

```javascript
const updateInteraction = async (postId, interactionType) => {
  // Immediately update local state
  const newInteractions = interactions.map(interaction => {
    if (interaction.postId === postId) {
      // Update interaction logic
    }
    return interaction;
  });

  // Optimistically update state
  setInteractions(newInteractions);

  try {
    // Send request to server
    // Update template schema
  } catch (error) {
    // Revert optimistic update on failure
    setInteractions(interactions);
  }
};
```
3. Updated UI components to reflect changes immediately:

```javascript
const handleUpvote = async () => {
  const newCounts = { ...interactionCounts };
  // Update local counts
  setInteractionCounts(newCounts);
  await updateInteraction(postId, "upvote");
};
```
This approach solved several issues:

The UI updates instantly, providing immediate feedback to users
The app feels more responsive, even under poor network conditions
A consistent state is maintained across components

While implementing this solution, I encountered and overcame several challenges:

Managing complex state across multiple components as a react beginner
Handling potential discrepancies between optimistic updates and server responses
Implementing fallback mechanisms for failed server updates

This implementation improved the overall user experience of the template gallery, making interactions feel more responsive and reliable.

## 7.2 Integrating PDF.js Repository Code with React

### Problem:
The challenge was to incorporate the full feature set of PDF.js into a React application. Off-the-shelf npm packages for PDF.js offered only basic functionality, which was insufficient for the advanced features required in EchoPDF. The goal was to leverage the complete suite of PDF.js capabilities, including the sidebar and annotation tools, while maintaining the flexibility to add more features in the future.

### Initial Approach:
The journey began with experimentation during the final year project phase. Initially, I worked directly with the PDF.js repository code, successfully implementing custom features on top of it. This experience provided valuable insights into the structure and capabilities of PDF.js.

The next step was to attempt running React code within this PDF.js setup. After some experimentation, I confirmed that it was indeed possible to integrate React into the PDF.js environment.

### Challenges:

1. **Webpack Configuration:**
   The primary hurdle was configuring Webpack to properly build and run the integrated project. This involved setting up the correct entry points, output paths, and resolving various module dependencies.

2. **Architectural Decision:**
   A critical decision point was whether to migrate PDF.js into a Create React App (CRA) setup or to bring React into the PDF.js structure. Given the complexity of PDF.js's internal path structure and imports, migrating it into a CRA setup proved to be impractical within the project's time constraints.

3. **Codebase Integration:**
   Moving the React code into the PDF.js repository structure required careful management of file paths and imports. This was particularly challenging due to the intricate dependency structure of PDF.js.

### Solution:

1. **Integration Strategy:**
   I decided to move the React code into the PDF.js repository structure. This approach allowed me to maintain the integrity of the PDF.js codebase while still leveraging React's component-based architecture.

2. **Webpack Configuration:**
   The Webpack configuration was crucial for the successful integration. Here's a simplified version of the key parts of the Webpack config:

```javascript
export default {
  entry: {
    main: "./react_app/index.js",
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "public"),
    filename: "[name].bundle.js",
    publicPath: "/",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            presets: ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
          },
        },
      },
      // ... other rules for CSS, SVG, etc.
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: path.resolve(__dirname, "react_app/index.html"),
      filename: "index.html",
      chunks: ["main"],
      inject: true,
    }),
    // ... other plugins
  ],
  resolve: {
    // Extensive alias configuration to map PDF.js internal paths
  },
};
```
Code Translation:
A significant part of the integration process involved translating the HTML structure of the PDF.js viewer into JSX. This required creating React components for various PDF.js elements and implementing state management where necessary. For example:

```jsx
const PDFViewer = () => {
  const [pageNum, setPageNum] = useState(1);
  
  // ... other state variables

  return (
    <div ref={viewerContainerRef} className={containerClass}>
      {/* Translated PDF.js viewer structure */}
      <div id="toolbarViewer">
        <input 
          type="number" 
          id="pageNumber" 
          className="toolbarField pageNumber" 
          title="Page" 
          value={pageNum} 
          onChange={handlePageNumChange} 
          size="4" 
          min="1" 
        />
        {/* ... other toolbar elements */}
      </div>
      {/* ... rest of the viewer structure */}
    </div>
  );
};
```
Handling Dynamic Imports:
PDF.js uses dynamic imports in some parts of its codebase. While I don't recall the exact details of how I resolved this, I remember it involved adjusting the Webpack configuration and potentially modifying some PDF.js code to make it compatible with the React setup.

Lessons Learned:

Build Tool Mastery: This integration deepened my understanding of build tools, particularly Webpack. I learned how to configure complex builds that merge different JavaScript paradigms and codebases.
Codebase Analysis: The process taught me how to analyze and work with large, complex codebases like PDF.js, identifying key integration points and necessary modifications.
Balancing Act: I learned the importance of maintaining a balance between leveraging existing code (PDF.js) and introducing new technology (React). This involved making judicious decisions about what to modify and what to keep intact.
Modular Design: The experience reinforced the value of modular design. By keeping the React components separate from the core PDF.js functionality, I maintained flexibility for future enhancements.
Problem-Solving Persistence: Tackling this integration challenged me to persist through complex problems, often requiring creative solutions and deep dives into both React and PDF.js documentation.

This integration process was a significant technical challenge that required a deeper understanding of both React and PDF.js, as well as configuration of build tools. The successful integration laid the groundwork for the advanced PDF viewing and interaction capabilities of EchoPDF, setting it apart from basic pdf viewer solutions using general PDF libraries.


## 7.3 Resolving Rendering and Responsiveness Issues in PDF.js-React Integration

### Problem:
After successfully integrating PDF.js with React, several critical rendering and responsiveness issues emerged. The PDF viewer, now wrapped in a React component, exhibited blank pages, misaligned annotations, and unresponsive UI elements. These issues threatened the core functionality of EchoPDF and required immediate attention.

### Challenges:

1. **Blank Viewer:**
   Upon initial render, the PDF viewer appeared blank and unresponsive, despite successful integration of the codebases.

2. **Scaling Discrepancies:**
   The annotation layer and thumbnails were misaligned with the actual PDF content, suggesting a scaling issue between different render layers.

3. **Zoom Functionality:**
   The zoom feature, critical for PDF viewing, was not functioning correctly within the new React component structure.

4. **CSS Responsiveness:**
   The original PDF.js CSS, particularly media queries, was not behaving as expected when wrapped in a React component.
   
5. **Color Customization:**
   Implementing a feature to control page background and text color required navigating the complex rendering process of PDF.js.
   
### Solution:

### 1. **Debugging Render Issues:**
   To address the blank viewer, I conducted a deep dive into both React's rendering process and PDF.js's initialization sequence. This involved:

   - Carefully examining the component lifecycle and ensuring PDF.js initialization occurred at the right moment.
   - Using React's useEffect hook to properly time the PDF.js viewer setup:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (isReady && signedUrl && fileName) {
    const config = getViewerConfiguration();
    PDFViewerApplication.run(config, signedUrl, fileName, colorParams);
  }
}, [isReady, signedUrl, fileName, colorMode]);
```

### 2. **Scaling Discrepancies:** 
The annotation layer and thumbnails were misaligned with the actual PDF content, suggesting a scaling issue between different render layers.

#### Investigation and Findings:
To address this issue, I conducted a thorough investigation:

1. **React Rendering Analysis:**
   * I delved into React's rendering process to understand how it interacts with the underlying HTML structure.
   * This investigation aimed to uncover any potential conflicts between React's virtual DOM and PDF.js's direct DOM manipulations.

2. **Ref Implementation:**
   * In an attempt to ensure proper synchronization between React and PDF.js, I implemented refs for all relevant PDF.js events, particularly those affecting the annotation layer.
   * I focused on the wrapper viewer containers, believing they might be key to resolving the scaling issue.
   * Example of ref implementation:

```jsx
const viewerContainerRef = useRef(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (viewerContainerRef.current) {
    // Attempted to use the ref for PDF.js initialization or event binding
    // PDFViewerApplication.initializeViewerComponents(viewerContainerRef.current);
  }
}, []);
```

   * Despite these efforts, the ref approach did not yield the expected results in fixing the scaling discrepancy.

3. **Browser Tools Investigation:**
   * When the ref approach proved ineffective, I shifted to a more direct investigation using browser developer tools.
   * I meticulously examined all aspects of the rendered PDF, including the main content layer, text layer, and annotation layer.
   * Through this process, I discovered that the annotation layer was consistently rendering at approximately 90% of the expected size – a 10% reduction in both width and height.

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
   * I compared the behavior in my React-wrapped version to the standalone PDF.js implementation.
   * This comparison confirmed that the scaling issue was unique to the React integration, as it did not exist in the original PDF.js viewer.

#### Conclusion: 
While I successfully identified the nature and extent of the scaling discrepancy (a 10% reduction), I have not yet implemented a fix or fully determined the root cause of this issue. The problem appears to be a side effect of wrapping PDF.js within a React component, but the exact mechanism causing this scaling difference remains unclear.

#### Next Steps:
* Further investigation into the interaction between React's rendering cycle and PDF.js's internal scaling mechanisms.
* Exploration of potential fixes, such as programmatically adjusting the scale of affected layers.
* Consideration of reaching out to the PDF.js community or React experts for insights on this specific integration challenge.

This scaling discrepancy remains an open issue, highlighting the complexities involved in integrating mature libraries like PDF.js into modern React applications. It serves as a reminder of the unexpected challenges that can arise in such integrations and the importance of thorough, multi-faceted debugging approaches.

### 3. **Zoom Functionality Repair:**
   The zoom issue stemmed from PDF.js expecting to control the entire window, which was no longer the case in the React setup. To fix this:

   - I removed PDF.js's default window resize listener.
   - Implemented a custom resize event handling using React refs and ResizeObserver:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const resizeObserver = new ResizeObserver(() => {
    PDFViewerApplication.eventBus.dispatch("resize", {
      source: viewerContainerRef.current,
    });
  });

  const viewerContainer = viewerContainerRef.current;
  if (viewerContainer) {
    resizeObserver.observe(viewerContainer);
  }

  return () => {
    if (viewerContainer) {
      resizeObserver.unobserve(viewerContainer);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

### 4. **CSS Responsiveness Solution:**
   To address the non-functioning media queries, I developed a system to dynamically apply classes based on the component's size rather than the window size:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const resizeObserver = new ResizeObserver(() => {
    if (viewerContainerRef.current) {
      const width = viewerContainerRef.current.offsetWidth;
      const classes = [];

      if (width <= 900) classes.push("toolbar-large");
      if (width <= 840) classes.push("toolbar-medium");
      if (width <= 750) classes.push("toolbar-small");
      if (width <= 690) classes.push("toolbar-extra-small");
      if (width <= 560) classes.push("toolbar-tiny");

      setContainerClass(classes.join(" "));
    }
  });

  const viewerContainer = viewerContainerRef.current;
  if (viewerContainer) {
    resizeObserver.observe(viewerContainer);
  }

  return () => {
    if (viewerContainer) {
      resizeObserver.unobserve(viewerContainer);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

This approach allowed for responsive behavior similar to media queries, but based on the component's dimensions rather than the viewport.

### 5. Color Control Implementation: 
To enhance user experience, I implemented a feature to control the page background and text color. This required a deep dive into PDF.js's rendering process.

#### Process:
1. **Investigation:** I conducted a thorough examination of PDF.js's codebase, tracing the rendering process from the high-level PDF application down to the canvas rendering.
2. **Visualization:** Using draw.io, I created a detailed diagram mapping out all relevant classes, their interactions, and parameter passing. This visual representation was crucial in understanding the complex flow of data and rendering instructions.
3. **Identifying Injection Points:** Through this analysis, I identified key points where custom color parameters could be injected into the rendering process.

#### Implementation: 
I created a color mode feature with options for dark, light, and original modes:

```jsx
const [colorMode, setColorMode] = useState("default"); // 'dark', 'light', 'default'

const toggleColorMode = () => {
  if (colorMode === "default") {
    setColorMode("dark");
  } else if (colorMode === "dark") {
    setColorMode("light");
  } else {
    setColorMode("default");
  }
};

const getColorParams = () => {
  switch (colorMode) {
    case "dark":
      return {
        backgroundColor: "#000000",
        textColor: "#FFFFFF",
      };
    case "light":
      return {
        backgroundColor: "#FFFFFF",
        textColor: "#000000",
      };
    default:
      return {};
  }
};
```

These color parameters are then passed down to the PDF.js initialization:

```jsx
PDFViewerApplication.run(config, signedUrl, fileName, getColorParams());
```

Within PDF.js, I modified the rendering process to accept and apply these color parameters, affecting both the page background and text rendering on the canvas.

#### Lessons Learned:
1. **Deep Dive Benefits:** This process highlighted the value of thoroughly understanding a complex system before attempting modifications. The visual mapping of the PDF.js structure was invaluable in navigating its complexity.
2. **Extensibility:** By identifying key injection points for color parameters, I've created a foundation for future enhancements, potentially allowing for more granular color control or even custom theming options.
3. **User Experience Focus:** This feature demonstrates a focus on user needs, providing options for comfortable reading in various lighting conditions.
4. **Modular Modifications:** The implementation showcases how targeted modifications can add significant functionality without overhauling the entire PDF.js system.

This color control feature not only enhances the current functionality of EchoPDF but also paves the way for more advanced customization options in the future, all while maintaining the core integrity of the PDF.js rendering process.



### Lessons Learned:

1. **Integration Complexity:**
   This experience highlighted the complex nature of integrating mature, full-featured libraries like PDF.js into a React ecosystem. It demonstrated the importance of understanding both the React component lifecycle and the internal workings of the integrated library.

2. **Debugging in Complex Systems:**
   The process of identifying and fixing these issues enhanced my debugging skills, particularly in scenarios involving multiple interacting systems. It emphasized the value of methodical investigation and the use of browser developer tools for pinpointing render and scaling issues.

3. **Creative Problem-Solving:**
   Addressing the responsiveness issues required thinking outside the conventional CSS paradigms. It taught me to approach styling and layout challenges creatively, especially when working within the constraints of a React component structure.

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   Implementing custom resize observers and dynamic class applications made me more aware of performance implications in responsive design. It highlighted the need to balance responsiveness with efficient re-rendering in React applications.

5. **Modular Design Benefits:**
   The challenges reinforced the value of modular design in complex integrations. By encapsulating PDF.js functionality within a React component, I was able to implement custom solutions without extensively modifying the PDF.js core, maintaining future upgrade paths.

This phase of the project was crucial in transforming the theoretical integration of PDF.js and React into a fully functional, responsive PDF viewer component. The solutions implemented not only resolved immediate issues but also laid the groundwork for future enhancements and feature additions in EchoPDF.


## 7.4 Custom Highlight Feature Implementation

### Problem Statement:
Early in the EchoPDF project development, PDF.js lacked native highlighting capabilities. To provide users with essential PDF interaction features, I needed to create a custom highlighting solution that could handle complex scenarios such as multi-page and overlapping highlights.

### Approach:
Inspired by PDF.js's text search highlighting mechanism, I developed a custom highlighting feature that directly manipulates the text layer of the PDF. This approach involved:

1. Capturing text selections using the browser's Range object
2. Creating a structured highlight data object
3. Manipulating the DOM to apply highlights
4. Handling complex scenarios like partial and complete overlaps
5. Ensuring highlight persistence across page reloads

### Key Challenges:
1. Accurately capturing and recreating text selections across multiple spans and pages
2. Managing various overlap scenarios (left, right, double, and complete)
3. Ensuring performance with large documents and numerous highlights
4. Integrating the feature with PDF.js's dynamic page rendering

### Solution Highlights:
* Implemented efficient DOM traversal using TreeWalker
* Developed algorithms for handling complex overlap scenarios
* Created a dual storage system (page-specific and master highlights) for efficient data management
* Utilized lazy rendering and batched DOM updates for performance optimization

### Key Learnings:
* Gained deep insights into DOM manipulation and PDF.js rendering processes
* Recognized the importance of staying updated with library developments
* Understood the value of being willing to pivot when better solutions emerge

While PDF.js later introduced its own highlighting feature, this project demonstrates the ability to conceptualize and implement complex features from scratch, showcasing problem-solving skills and the capacity to work with intricate document structures.

## 7.5 Real-time Streaming and Markdown Parsing

### Problem Statement:
During the early development of EchoPDF's AI chat feature, I encountered a challenge with rendering markdown from streaming text responses. I was concerned about potential performance issues when updating and re-rendering large chunks of text with each new incoming fragment from the ChatGPT API.

### Initial Approach:
Believing that existing markdown libraries might be inefficient for handling constantly updating, streaming text, I embarked on developing a custom markdown parser. The goals were to:
1. Parse markdown in real-time as text chunks are received
2. Efficiently render parsed content without causing performance issues
3. Handle complex nested structures, especially for list elements

### Key Challenges:
1. Designing a parser that could handle incomplete markdown elements across multiple chunks
2. Managing internal state to track nested structures
3. Efficiently updating only necessary parts of the rendered output
4. Handling various markdown elements (emphasis, lists, headers, code blocks) in a streaming context

### Solution Implementation:
I developed a custom markdown parser using vanilla JavaScript, which included:
* A main parser class to orchestrate the parsing process
* Specialized handlers for different markdown elements (emphasis, lists, headers, code blocks)
* A stack-based approach for managing nested structures
* Real-time processing of individual text chunks

The parser was designed to build a hierarchical structure of HTML elements as it processed incoming markdown, with the ability to handle incomplete elements across multiple chunks.

### Key Learnings and Realizations:
1. Overengineering: I realized that I had overengineered a solution to a problem that existing tools could handle efficiently.
2. React's Capabilities: Later, I learned that React's virtual DOM and efficient update mechanisms can handle frequent updates to large text blocks without significant performance issues.
3. Browser Performance: I underestimated modern browsers' ability to efficiently update and render DOM changes.
4. Importance of Research: This experience highlighted the value of thoroughly researching existing solutions before building custom tools.
5. Rapid Skill Evolution: The project showcased how quickly development skills can evolve, as I transitioned from vanilla JS to React during this period.

### Final Outcome:
Ultimately, the custom parser was not used in the final EchoPDF implementation. Instead, I found that using existing markdown libraries with React's state management provided a simpler and equally efficient solution for handling streaming markdown text.

While the custom parser wasn't necessary for the final product, the process of building it provided valuable experience in handling streaming data, working with markdown, and understanding the intricacies of real-time text processing.

For a detailed look at the custom markdown parser implementation, including code and a more in-depth discussion of the challenges and lessons learned, visit the [Custom Markdown Parser repository](https://github.com/origin405/custom-markdown-parser).

This experience serves as a reminder of the importance of research, the value of learning from "mistakes," and the rapid evolution of skills in web development.

## 7.6 RAG System Implementation
### 7.6.1 Vector Database Integration (Pinecone)

EchoPDF's RAG system relies on efficient storage and retrieval of document vectors. This is achieved through a combination of Pinecone, a vector database, and MongoDB for metadata storage. The integration process involves several key components:

#### Embedding Generation:
* Document text is embedded using OpenAI's Ada-2 model, creating dense vector representations of the content.
* These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling similarity-based retrieval.

#### Vector Storage in Pinecone:
* The generated embeddings are stored in Pinecone, a specialized vector database optimized for similarity search.
* Each vector is associated with metadata including the original text, page number, and other relevant information.

#### Metadata Storage in MongoDB:
* To optimize retrieval and manage vector IDs efficiently, a separate MongoDB collection is used.
* The schema for this collection is defined as follows:

```javascript
const pdfVectorSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    _id: { type: String, required: true, },
    userId: { type: String, required: true, index: true, },
    vectorIDs: { type: [String], required: true, default: [], },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

pdfVectorSchema.index({ _id: 1, userId: 1 });
```

* This schema allows for efficient lookup of vector IDs associated with a specific PDF and user.

#### Vector Retrieval Process:
1. When a query is received, the system first checks MongoDB for the relevant vector IDs.
2. Using these IDs, the actual vectors are fetched from Pinecone.
3. The retrieved vectors, along with their metadata, are then used for similarity matching and context retrieval.

#### Efficient Data Flow:
* After retrieval, relevant vector content and metadata are sent to the client.
* This allows the client to maintain a local copy for quick reference and use in generating the final ChatGPT response.

This integrated approach offers several advantages:
* Separation of concerns: Pinecone handles vector storage and similarity search, while MongoDB manages metadata and IDs.
* Scalability: The system can handle large numbers of documents and users efficiently.
* Performance: By storing vector IDs separately, the system can quickly determine which vectors to retrieve without querying the entire vector database.

The combination of Pinecone for vector storage and MongoDB for metadata management creates a robust foundation for EchoPDF's RAG system, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of relevant document sections for enhanced AI-powered interactions.


### 7.6.2 Efficient Vector Retrieval and Selection

A critical component of EchoPDF's RAG system is the efficient retrieval and selection of relevant vectors. This process balances the need for context-relevant information with user-specific constraints and query relevance. The implementation involves several key aspects:

#### Vector Selector Algorithm:
The core of the selection process is the `vectorSelector` function, which implements a sophisticated algorithm to choose the most relevant vectors. This algorithm considers:
1. Query relevance: Vectors are categorized based on their similarity scores to the user's query.
2. Page specificity: Vectors are prioritized based on explicitly mentioned pages or page ranges in the user's query.
3. Word count limits: Selection respects user tier-specific word limits for RAG content.

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Prioritize vectors from explicitly mentioned individual pages.
2. Include vectors with high similarity scores (>=0.8).
3. Balance between individual page vectors and high-scoring query vectors.
4. Include page range vectors if applicable.
5. Fill remaining space with lower-scoring but still relevant vectors.

```javascript
const finalizeVectorSelection = (
  queriedVecBelow78,
  queriedVecBelow80,
  queriedVecAboveOrEqual80,
  individualPageVecIds,
  pageRangeVecIds
) => {
  // ... (implementation details)
};
```

#### Balancing Page-Specific and Query-Relevant Vectors:
The system strikes a balance between honoring user-specified pages and including highly relevant content from other parts of the document:
1. Individual page vectors are given top priority to ensure user-specified content is included.
2. High-scoring query-relevant vectors (score >= 0.8) are included next to provide context beyond explicitly mentioned pages.
3. A mix of individual page vectors and moderately high-scoring vectors (0.78 <= score < 0.8) is then added.
4. Page range vectors are included to cover broader specified sections.
5. Remaining space is filled with lower-scoring but still relevant vectors.

#### Handling Different User Tiers and Word Limits:
The system adapts to different user tiers by adjusting the word limit for RAG content:
* Free tier: 800 words
* Plus tier: 1000 words
* Pro tier: 1200 words
* GPT-4 access (via credits): 3000 words

This tiered approach is implemented in the vector selection process:

```javascript
if (
  (!individualPageVecIds || individualPageVecIds.length === 0) &&
  (!queriedVecAboveOrEqual80 || queriedVecAboveOrEqual80.length === 0) &&
  ragWordLimit >= 800
) {
  addVectors([queriedVecBelow80.shift()]);
}
```

This conditional logic allows for including additional moderately relevant vectors when the word limit permits, providing a richer context for higher-tier users.

#### Challenges and Considerations:
1. Balancing Act: Achieving the right balance between page-specific vectors and query-relevant vectors remains an ongoing challenge, requiring continuous refinement based on user feedback and performance metrics.
2. Handling Large Page Ranges: When users specify large page ranges, the system employs a sampling strategy to ensure diverse coverage without exceeding word limits.
3. Performance Optimization: The selection algorithm is designed to be efficient, but as the system scales, ongoing optimization may be necessary to maintain low latency.
4. User Intent Interpretation: The system makes assumptions about user intent when balancing between specified pages and query relevance. These assumptions may need adjustment based on real-world usage patterns.

#### Future Improvements:
* Implement more sophisticated scoring mechanisms for vector relevance.
* Develop adaptive algorithms that learn from user interactions to improve vector selection over time.
* Explore options for allowing users more control over the balance between page-specificity and query relevance.

This efficient vector retrieval and selection process forms the backbone of EchoPDF's RAG system, enabling contextually relevant and user-tier appropriate responses to queries.

### 7.6.3 Natural Language Processing for Page-Specific Queries

EchoPDF's RAG system includes a sophisticated approach to handling page-specific queries, which evolved through experimentation and problem-solving. This section details the journey from the initial concept to the current implementation, highlighting the challenges and insights gained along the way.

#### Initial Approach: Embedding Page Numbers in Vectors

##### Concept:
- The original idea was to embed page number metadata directly into the document vectors stored in Pinecone.
- The goal was to enable direct retrieval of page-specific content through semantic similarity searches.

##### Implementation Attempt:
- Page numbers were included as part of the text content during the embedding process.
- The hypothesis was that embedding models like Ada-2 would capture the semantics of page numbers along with the document content.

##### Challenges Encountered:
- Current embedding techniques, including OpenAI's Ada-2, proved insufficient in capturing the nuanced relationship between page numbers and content in a way that allowed for reliable retrieval.
- Queries mentioning specific pages or ranges failed to consistently retrieve the correct vectors, indicating that the embedding process wasn't effectively incorporating page number information in a semantically meaningful way.

##### Insights Gained:
- This experiment revealed the limitations of current embedding technologies in handling structured metadata like page numbers alongside unstructured text content.
- It became clear that a more specialized approach was needed to effectively handle page-specific queries.

#### Transition to ChatGPT-Based Solution

After recognizing the limitations of the embedding-based approach, EchoPDF pivoted to a more effective solution leveraging ChatGPT's natural language understanding capabilities.

#### Current Implementation: ChatGPT Integration for Page Number Extraction

##### Approach:
- Instead of relying on vector embeddings to capture page information, the system now uses ChatGPT to extract page numbers and ranges from user queries.

##### Implementation:
- User queries are processed through a dedicated ChatGPT endpoint designed for page number extraction.
- The system employs prompt engineering to instruct ChatGPT to focus on identifying and extracting page-related information.

##### Integration with Vector Retrieval:
- Once page numbers are extracted, the system retrieves relevant vectors using their IDs from Pinecone.
- The content associated with these vectors is then accessed from a local copy, allowing for efficient page-specific content retrieval.

##### Example Implementation:
```javascript
const pageData = await fetchChatgptPageCheck(
  userMessage.content,
  userMessage.wordCount
);
```

#### Advantages of Current Approach:
- Flexibility in interpreting various ways users might specify pages or ranges.
- Ability to handle complex or ambiguous page references more effectively than rule-based systems.
- Separation of concerns: page number extraction is handled separately from content retrieval, allowing for better optimization of each process.

### Challenges and Considerations:

#### Model Selection and Performance:
- The system currently uses GPT-3.5-turbo, balancing cost and accuracy.
- There's potential for improved accuracy with more advanced models like GPT-4, at the cost of increased processing expenses.

#### API Call Overhead:
- Each query requiring page extraction adds an extra API call, impacting response time and operational costs.

#### Handling Ambiguity:
- The system must interpret and handle cases where page references in queries are unclear or have multiple possible interpretations.

#### Future Improvements:

##### Hybrid Approaches:
- Exploring combinations of rule-based systems for simple cases and AI-based extraction for complex queries to optimize performance and reduce API calls.

##### Continuous Learning:
- Implementing feedback mechanisms to improve page number extraction accuracy over time based on user interactions.

##### Caching and Optimization:
- For frequently accessed documents, caching common page-specific query results to reduce repeated processing.

The evolution from attempting to embed page numbers directly in vectors to the current ChatGPT-based solution demonstrates EchoPDF's commitment to innovative problem-solving. This journey highlights the importance of flexibility in approach and the value of leveraging specialized AI capabilities to enhance the overall effectiveness of the RAG system. The current implementation not only solves the immediate challenge of page-specific queries but also provides a foundation for future enhancements in natural language understanding within document interaction systems.

### Future Enhancements:

#### 1. Chat with Folder Feature:
   * Implement vector creation immediately after successful S3 upload to ensure all PDFs in a folder are ready for RAG processing.
   * Explore two potential approaches for folder interactions:
     a. Concatenated PDF View: Allow users to view and chat with all PDFs in a folder as a single document.
     b. Individual PDF Chat with Folder Context: Enable chatting with individual PDFs while maintaining awareness of the folder context.
   * Develop strategies for efficient vector retrieval across multiple documents within a folder.
   * Address page number challenges in multi-document scenarios:
      * For concatenated PDFs: Implement a system to map original page numbers to the new combined document structure.
      * For individual PDF chat: Maintain original page numbers but develop a method to reference content across different documents in the folder.
   * Consider adapting or potentially removing the page-specific feature for folder-level chats, depending on usability and technical constraints.

#### 2. Optimization of Multi-Document RAG:
   * Research methods to balance processing time, storage requirements, and query performance when dealing with multiple PDFs in a folder.
   * Investigate techniques for maintaining context coherence when retrieving information from various documents within a folder.

These enhancements present complex challenges that will require careful planning and implementation. As I continue to develop EchoPDF, tackling these issues will provide valuable learning experiences in handling multi-document scenarios and scaling RAG systems.

The process of expanding EchoPDF's capabilities to handle folder-level interactions will likely involve revisiting and adapting many aspects of the current system. This iterative development process is an exciting opportunity to deepen my understanding of document processing, vector databases, and large-scale RAG implementations.

### 7.6.5 Challenges and Optimizations

In developing the RAG system for EchoPDF, I encountered several challenges that required careful problem-solving and optimization. This section outlines the key issues faced and the solutions implemented to enhance the system's performance.

#### 1. Handling Large Documents and Vector Batches

**Challenge:** Processing large PDF documents could generate a number of vectors exceeding Pinecone's single batch upload limit of 4MB.

**Solution:** Implemented a chunking mechanism for vector uploads:

```javascript
const vectorsSize = getSizeInBytes(vectors);
const MAX_SIZE = 4000000; // Pinecone's limit in bytes

if (vectorsSize > MAX_SIZE) {
  const chunkSize = Math.ceil((vectors.length * MAX_SIZE) / vectorsSize);
  for (let i = 0; i < vectors.length; i += chunkSize) {
    const chunk = vectors.slice(i, i + chunkSize);
    await namespace.upsert(chunk);
  }
} else {
  await namespace.upsert(vectors);
}
```

This approach ensures that large documents can be processed and stored effectively, maintaining system reliability for documents of varying sizes.

#### 2. Efficient Vector Retrieval and Usage

**Challenge:** Retrieving and using vector data efficiently for each query.

**Solution:** Implemented a local caching system for vector data:
* Fetch vector IDs and metadata from Pinecone once.
* Store a local copy of the vector content and metadata on the client side.
* For subsequent queries, use the locally stored data to construct prompts for ChatGPT.

This approach reduces the need for repeated large data transfers between the server and client, improving response times and reducing server load.

#### 3. Balancing Vector Selection

**Challenge:** Selecting the most relevant vectors while respecting user tier limits and maintaining query relevance.

**Solution:** Developed a sophisticated vector selection algorithm that prioritizes vectors based on query relevance, page specificity, and user tier limits:

```javascript
const finalizeVectorSelection = (
  queriedVecBelow78,
  queriedVecBelow80,
  queriedVecAboveOrEqual80,
  individualPageVecIds,
  pageRangeVecIds
) => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

This algorithm ensures a balance between explicitly mentioned pages, highly relevant content, and overall context, adapting to different user tiers.

## 7.7 Pinecone Resource Allocation

The solution implements a sophisticated system for allocating Pinecone resources (indexes and namespaces) to users based on their tier (free or paid). Here are the key components and strategies:

### 1. Middleware Approach:
   * Utilizes a middleware function `ensureNamespace` to check and allocate resources for each user before processing their requests.

### 2. Tier-Based Allocation:
   * Free users:
      * Shared namespaces within a single "free-index"
      * Up to 1000 users per namespace
   * Paid users:
      * Dedicated namespaces
      * Distributed across multiple paid indexes

### 3. Dynamic Resource Management:
   * Automatically creates new namespaces or indexes when current ones reach capacity.
   * Uses counter models (`FreeNamespaceCounter` and `PaidIndexCounter`) to track resource usage.

### 4. Scalability:
   * Can handle up to 10,000,000 free users (10,000 namespaces * 1000 users per namespace).
   * Supports up to 190,000 paid users (19 paid indexes * 10,000 namespaces).

### 5. Upgrade Handling:
   * Seamlessly manages user upgrades from free to paid tier.
   * Reallocates resources and cleans up old data when a user upgrades.

### 6. Error Handling:
   * Implements checks to prevent exceeding Pinecone tier limits.
   * Throws appropriate errors when resource limits are reached.

### Key Implementation Details:

1. Free User Allocation:

```javascript
async function allocateFreeNamespace() {
  // ... (implementation details)
}
```

* Manages shared namespaces for free users.
* Creates new namespaces when the current one reaches 1000 users.

2. Paid User Allocation:

```javascript
async function allocatePaidNamespace() {
  // ... (implementation details)
}
```

* Allocates dedicated namespaces for paid users.
* Distributes paid users across multiple indexes.

3. Upgrade Handling:

```javascript
if (
  user.hasPaid &&
  user.pineconeNamespace &&
  user.pineconeIndex === "free-index"
) {
  // User is upgrading from free to paid
  // ... (upgrade logic)
}
```

* Detects and manages user upgrades.
* Reallocates resources and cleans up old data.

4. MongoDB Models for Tracking:

```javascript
export const FreeNamespaceCounter = mongoose.model(
  "FreeNamespaceCounter",
  freeNamespaceCounterSchema
);

export const PaidIndexCounter = mongoose.model(
  "PaidIndexCounter",
  paidIndexCounterSchema
);
```

* Uses MongoDB to persistently track resource allocation.

This solution effectively addresses the challenges of resource allocation in EchoPDF, providing a scalable and flexible system that can accommodate both free and paid users while maximizing the use of limited Pinecone resources.


## 7.8 Stripe Integration and Testing

Integrating Stripe for payment processing and subscription management was a crucial aspect of EchoPDF's development. This section outlines the implementation process, challenges faced, and the testing strategies employed.

### 7.8.1 Stripe Webhook Implementation

The core of the Stripe integration revolves around webhook handlers that respond to various payment and subscription events:

```javascript
app.post("/webhook", express.raw({ type: "application/json" }), (request, response) => {
  // Webhook signature verification and event handling
  switch (event.type) {
    case "customer.subscription.deleted":
      handleSubscriptionDeleted(event.data.object);
      break;
    case "customer.subscription.updated":
      handleSubscriptionUpdated(event.data.object);
      break;
    case "invoice.paid":
      handleInvoicePaid(event.data.object);
      break;
    case "invoice.payment_failed":
      handleInvoicePaymentFailed(event.data.object);
      break;
    case "checkout.session.completed":
      handleCheckoutSessionCompleted(event.data.object);
      break;
    // ... other event handlers
  }
});
```

Each event type is associated with a specific handler function that updates the user's subscription status, credits, or other relevant information in the database.

### 7.8.2 User Schema for Subscription Management

A comprehensive user schema was developed to track subscription details, payment history, and usage statistics:

```javascript
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  // ... other fields
  subscription: {
    status: String,
    currentPeriodStart: Date,
    currentPeriodEnd: Date,
    cancelAtPeriodEnd: Boolean,
    stripeSubscriptionId: String,
    stripePriceId: String,
    scheduledChange: {
      planId: String,
      effectiveDate: Date,
      planName: String,
    },
    planName: String,
  },
  subscriptionHistory: [/* ... */],
  credits: Number,
  totalPurchasedCredits: Number,
  // ... other fields
});
```

This schema allows for detailed tracking of user subscriptions, including scheduled changes and historical data.

### 7.8.3 Testing Strategies

Testing the Stripe integration posed unique challenges due to the need to simulate various payment scenarios. Several approaches were employed:

1. **Stripe CLI for Local Testing:**
   - Used the Stripe CLI to trigger webhook events locally.
   - Employed the `stripe listen` command to forward events to the local development server.

2. **Custom Customer ID Override:**
   - Discovered a method to use custom customer IDs in test events:
     ```
     stripe trigger invoice.paid --add customer=cus_existing_id
     ```
   - This allowed testing with existing user data in the development database.

3. **JSON Fixtures for Complex Scenarios:**
   - Utilized Stripe CLI's fixture feature for more complex event simulations:
```json
     {
       "fixtures": [
         {
           "name": "subscription_schedule",
           "path": "/v1/subscription_schedules",
           "method": "post",
           "params": {
             "customer": "cus_QSM2eIHGjTs7By",
             "start_date": "now",
             "phases": {
               "0": {
                 "iterations": 1,
                 "items": [
                   {
                     "price": "price_1PbQygG5ZucJe3JrYoW7SVQ0",
                     "quantity": 1
                   }
                 ]
               }
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
```
   - This approach allowed for precise control over event parameters and testing of complex subscription scenarios.

### 7.8.4 Challenges and Learnings

1. **Customer ID Management:**
   - Initially struggled with using custom customer IDs in test events.
   - Learned to use the override feature in Stripe CLI for more realistic testing scenarios.

2. **Comprehensive Event Testing:**
   - Realized the importance of testing all possible subscription events (creation, update, deletion, payment failure).
   - Future improvements include creating a more comprehensive set of JSON fixtures for thorough testing of all event types.

3. **Subscription Lifecycle Management:**
   - Implemented logic to handle various subscription states, including scheduled changes and cancellations.
   - Learned the importance of maintaining a detailed subscription history for troubleshooting and user support.

4. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Implemented robust error handling and logging for webhook events to facilitate debugging and ensure system reliability.

### 7.8.5 Future Improvements

1. **Automated Testing Suite:**
   - Develop a comprehensive automated testing suite using Stripe's test mode and CLI fixtures.
   - Create scenarios for all possible subscription and payment events.

2. **Improved Subscription Change Handling:**
   - Refine the logic for handling subscription upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations to ensure smooth transitions between different tiers.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Analytics:**
   - Implement more detailed logging and analytics for payment and subscription events to gain insights into user behavior and potential issues.

The Stripe integration process was a significant learning experience, highlighting the complexities of handling real-time payment events and subscription management. While the current implementation provides a solid foundation for EchoPDF's payment system, there's room for improvement in testing methodologies and event handling comprehensiveness. This experience has provided valuable insights into building robust payment systems for SaaS applications.

It's worth noting that testing Stripe was one of the most stressful moments during my EchoPDF development journey. The implications and seriousness surrounding payments meant that I couldn't afford to make any mistakes. The pressure was particularly intense as I was developing this crucial feature while delaying the launch of EchoPDF. The combination of financial responsibility and time constraints made this phase of development especially challenging and anxiety-inducing.

### Conclusion of Development Journey

The development of EchoPDF has been an intense journey over the past 4-5 months. Starting with limited full-stack development experience, I've managed to create and launch a functional AI-powered PDF management platform. It's been a challenging process, filled with both technical hurdles and personal obstacles.

Throughout this period, I faced constant family pressure to pursue traditional employment instead of this project. The looming deadline of my allowance being cut off around July added significant stress to the development process. Personally since I was a kid, more strongly when i hit my teenage years, I always have high expectations for myself to be sucessful. It was these expectations and fears of not making it early lead me to bad life choices. It's one of the reason why I graduated at 26, rather than ideally at 22. The insecurity of being behind the race, and also being financially insecure knowing that the world economy is headed towards a disaster, in a world of high debt, bubble financial markets, high inflation, out of control governments, all these stress built up within me every day. These internal and external pressures, combined with the technical challenges of the project, created a demanding and often stressful work environment.

Self-doubt was a persistent issue. I frequently questioned whether what I was doing was worthwhile, whether it would lead to the job opportunities I hoped for, and whether I was capable of completing the project to a satisfactory standard to land my dream job. These insecurities, coupled with financial and career uncertainties, added an extra layer of difficulty to the already challenging task of software development.

The technical aspects of the project were particularly demanding. Learning React for the first time, implementing complex features like the RAG system and chat flow, integrating Stripe, and deploying the application all presented significant challenges. Debugging the custom-wrapped PDF.js with React was especially time-consuming and complex.

My initial timeline estimates proved overly optimistic. I had to delay the launch several times, moving from an initial June target to July 1st, then to July 10th, and finally launching on July 15th. The complexity of Stripe integration and deployment issues were primary factors in these delays.

Looking back, there are several things I would approach differently. I should have maintained a better work-life balance, including regular exercise, which likely would have improved my productivity and mental state. The two weeks spent on design work early in the project, which was largely unused in the final product, could have been better utilized on core functionality.

In the end, I've somehow managed to launch EchoPDF with its core features intact. The next steps include polishing the UI, implementing the one-click template copy feature, and preparing for job applications. I'm hopeful that the free tier of EchoPDF will demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers.

This journey has been incredibly demanding, but also educational. I've gained valuable experience not just in coding and full-stack development, but also in project management, problem-solving, and perseverance under pressure. While the long-term value of this project remains to be seen, the skills and resilience I've developed throughout this process will undoubtedly be beneficial in my future endeavors.

The coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining whether this intense period of work will pay off in terms of career opportunities. Regardless of the outcome, the knowledge and experience gained from developing EchoPDF hopefully represent significant personal and professional growth.
